# Map-Up

The application uses the location data of upcoming events from Meetup.com and plots the coordinates on a map displaying where the events will take place. Once the points are plotted, the user can click on a point and a pop up will display the event information such as the event title, meetup group, date and time of event, and the RSVP Tally or Waitlist Tally. The application allows for the user to filter the results by date and subject. The user can also save the event for future reference. The user can click on an attached link in the popup or sidebar to navigate to the events page on Meetup.com.
